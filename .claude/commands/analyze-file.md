# Analyze File

This command performs deep code analysis on a specified file to identify optimization opportunities, readability improvements, and adherence to best practices (Clean Code, DRY, SOLID).

## Usage

```bash
/analyze-file <file-path>
```

**Example:** `/analyze-file libs/question-randomizer/dashboard/shared/data-access/src/store/question-list.store.ts`

## Your Task

1. **Read and understand the file:**
   - Read the specified file completely
   - Understand its purpose, dependencies, and context
   - Identify the type of code (component, service, store, utility, etc.)

2. **Perform comprehensive analysis across these dimensions:**

   ### Code Organization & Structure
   - Are functions/methods too long or complex? (suggest splitting into smaller units)
   - Is the file doing too many things? (Single Responsibility Principle)
   - Are related functions grouped logically?
   - Is the code structure intuitive and easy to navigate?

   ### Naming Conventions & Intuitive Function Names ⚠️ CRITICAL
   **Function/Method Names:**
   - **Clarity:** Does the name clearly describe what the function does?
   - **Verb usage:** Does it use proper verbs? (get/fetch/load/create/update/delete/calculate/etc.)
   - **Verb accuracy:** Does "get" imply side-effect-free retrieval? Does "create" imply persistence?
   - **Length:** Is it concise but not abbreviated? (avoid: `updCtgQstLstId`, prefer: `updateQuestionCategory`)
   - **Consistency:** Do similar operations use consistent naming patterns?
   - **Intuitiveness:** Can a developer understand the purpose without reading implementation?
   - **Boolean methods:** Do predicates start with is/has/should/can? (e.g., `shouldSkipLoading`)
   - **Redundancy:** Does it avoid repeating type names? (bad: `UserService.getUserUser()`)

   **Parameter Names:**
   - **Descriptive:** Avoid abbreviations (bad: `usrId`, `qDic` - good: `userId`, `questionMap`)
   - **Conventions:** Follow language conventions (TypeScript uses `Map` not `Dic` for Record types)
   - **Context:** Clear without needing to check types

   **Variable Names:**
   - Self-documenting code over comments
   - Avoid single letters (except loop indices)
   - Boolean variables should read like questions (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)

   ### Readability & Documentation
   **Code Documentation:**
   - **JSDoc coverage:** Do all public methods/functions have JSDoc comments?
   - **JSDoc completeness:** Do they document params, returns, exceptions, and include examples?
   - **Comment quality:** Are comments explaining "why" not "what"?
   - **Self-documenting code:** Is the code clear enough that comments aren't needed for basic understanding?

   **Code Clarity:**
   - **Complex expressions:** Are ternary operators nested? Boolean logic hard to parse?
   - **Magic values:** Are there hardcoded numbers/strings that should be named constants?
   - **Nesting depth:** Are there deeply nested conditions (>3 levels) or loops?
   - **Function length:** Can you understand a function without scrolling?
   - **Cognitive load:** Can you understand the code without keeping too much context in your head?

   ### Clean Code Principles
   **Function Design:**
   - **Single purpose:** Does each function do ONE thing well?
   - **Function size:** Are functions <20 lines ideally, <50 lines maximum?
   - **Parameter count:** Are there ≤3 parameters? (More suggests need for object parameter)
   - **Return consistency:** Do functions return same type consistently? (avoid mixed returns)

   **Code Organization:**
   - **Separation of concerns:** Are business logic, data access, and UI clearly separated?
   - **Abstraction levels:** Does each function operate at one level of abstraction?
   - **Dependencies:** Are dependencies injected rather than created internally?
   - **Cohesion:** Are related functions grouped together?

   ### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
   - Identify duplicated code blocks
   - Repeated logic that could be extracted
   - Similar patterns that could use shared utilities
   - Duplicated type definitions

   ### SOLID Principles (Practical Checks)
   **Single Responsibility - Check for:**
   - Does the class/function have multiple reasons to change?
   - Can you describe what it does in one sentence without using "and"?
   - Does it mix concerns? (e.g., data fetching AND business logic AND UI updates)

   **Open/Closed - Check for:**
   - Are there long if/else or switch statements that need modification when adding features?
   - Could new behavior be added via composition/inheritance instead of modification?
   - Are enums/constants used that require code changes when new types are added?

   **Liskov Substitution - Check for:**
   - Do derived classes throw unexpected errors?
   - Do child classes violate parent class contracts?
   - Can you swap derived types without breaking code?

   **Interface Segregation - Check for:**
   - Do interfaces force implementations of unused methods?
   - Are there "fat" interfaces that do too much?
   - Could interfaces be split into smaller, focused contracts?

   **Dependency Inversion - Check for:**
   - Does code depend on concrete implementations instead of abstractions?
   - Are dependencies created with `new` instead of injected?
   - Could dependencies be mocked/swapped for testing?

   ### Error Handling & Resilience ⚠️ CRITICAL
   **Consistency:**
   - **Pattern uniformity:** Is error handling consistent across all methods?
   - **Centralization:** Is there repeated try-catch logic that could be centralized?
   - **DRY violation:** Is the same error handling code copy-pasted everywhere?

   **Quality:**
   - **Error messages:** Are error messages descriptive and actionable?
   - **Error types:** Are different error types handled appropriately?
   - **User communication:** Are user-facing errors clear and helpful?
   - **Logging:** Are errors logged with enough context for debugging?

   **Recovery:**
   - **Graceful degradation:** Does the app fail gracefully?
   - **Resource cleanup:** Are resources (subscriptions, connections) cleaned up on errors?
   - **Side effects:** Are partial state changes rolled back on error?

   ### Immutability & State Management ⚠️ CRITICAL (Angular/Signals)
   **Direct Mutations - Check for:**
   - **Object mutations:** Are objects mutated directly? (e.g., `obj.property = value`)
   - **Array mutations:** Using `.push()`, `.splice()`, `.sort()` instead of immutable alternatives?
   - **Parameter mutations:** Are function parameters modified?
   - **Spread operators:** Are new objects created with `{...obj}` or `[...array]`?

   **State Updates:**
   - **Signal updates:** Are Angular Signals updated correctly (`.set()`, `.update()` with new references)?
   - **Store patterns:** Does state management follow immutable patterns?
   - **Reference equality:** Can change detection work properly with immutable updates?

   **Impact:**
   - **Change detection:** Will Angular detect changes correctly?
   - **Debugging:** Are bugs caused by unintended mutations?
   - **Predictability:** Is state predictable and traceable?

   ### Side Effects & Command-Query Separation
   **Pure Functions:**
   - **Side effect identification:** Which functions have side effects (API calls, mutations, logging)?
   - **Function naming:** Do names accurately reflect side effects? ("get" should be side-effect-free)
   - **Isolation:** Are side effects isolated and clearly marked?

   **Command-Query Separation:**
   - **Queries:** Do "get/fetch/find" methods only return data without mutations?
   - **Commands:** Do "create/update/delete" methods only mutate without returning data (except IDs)?
   - **Violations:** Are there functions that both query AND command?

   ### Testability & Test Coverage
   **Code Testability:**
   - **Dependency injection:** Are dependencies injected (mockable) or hard-coded?
   - **Function size:** Are functions small enough to test easily?
   - **Pure functions:** How many functions are pure (easier to test)?
   - **Hidden dependencies:** Are there global state dependencies or static calls?

   **Test Existence:**
   - **Test file:** Does a corresponding `.spec.ts` file exist?
   - **Coverage:** What's the estimated test coverage for critical paths?
   - **Test quality:** Are tests meaningful or just achieving coverage?
   - **Edge cases:** Are error cases and edge cases tested?

   ### Dependencies & Coupling
   **Dependency Analysis:**
   - **Dependency count:** How many services/dependencies are injected? (>5 is a smell)
   - **Circular dependencies:** Are there circular dependencies?
   - **Tight coupling:** Is the code tightly coupled to specific implementations?
   - **God objects:** Are there dependencies that do too much?

   **Coupling Issues:**
   - **Feature envy:** Does code reach deep into other objects? (`obj.prop.subProp.value`)
   - **Inappropriate intimacy:** Does code know too much about other classes' internals?
   - **Hidden coupling:** Are there implicit dependencies (order of operations, shared state)?

   ### Performance & Optimization
   - Unnecessary computations or loops
   - Inefficient algorithms or data structures
   - Memory leaks (subscriptions not cleaned up, etc.)
   - Redundant API calls or database queries
   - Missing memoization opportunities

   ### TypeScript Best Practices
   - Type safety (any types, missing type annotations)
   - Proper use of generics
   - Union types vs enums
   - Unnecessary type assertions

   ### Angular-Specific (if applicable)
   - Change detection optimization
   - OnPush strategy opportunities
   - Proper lifecycle hook usage
   - Signal patterns and computed values
   - Dependency injection patterns

## Example Output Format

```markdown
# Code Analysis: question-list.store.ts

## Summary
- **Overall Quality:** Good (7/10)
- **Issues Found:** 18 (6 High, 8 Medium, 4 Low)
- **Primary Concerns:** Immutability violations, error handling inconsistency, function naming
- **Quality Breakdown:**
  - Naming: 6/10 (4 poor function names)

  - Error Handling: 4/10 (6 duplicated patterns)
  - Testability: 7/10 (tests exist but missing edge cases)
  - Code Structure: 8/10 (well organized)

## Function Naming Analysis

### ✅ Good Function Names
- `loadQuestions` - Clear, follows convention
- `shouldRetry` - Proper boolean naming
- `clearCache` - Action is explicit

### ⚠️ Functions Needing Better Names

#### 1. `getNewQuestions` - Misleading Verb
**Current:** `getNewQuestions(userId: string)`
**Issue:** "get" implies retrieval without side effects, but this creates records in Firestore
**Severity:** High

**Recommended alternatives:**
- `createQuestions(userId: string)` ✅ Best - matches actual behavior
- `initializeQuestions(userId: string)` ✅ Alternative
- `buildQuestionList(userId: string)` ✅ Alternative

**Impact:** Violates Command-Query Separation, misleads developers

#### 2. `updateQstCatLstId` - Poor Abbreviations
**Current:** `updateQstCatLstId(qDic: Record<string, Question>)`
**Issue:** Heavy abbreviations make code unreadable
**Severity:** High

**Recommended alternatives:**
- `updateQuestionCategoryListIds(questionMap: Record<string, Question>)` ✅ Best
- `syncQuestionCategories(questionMap: Record<string, Question>)` ✅ Alternative

**Parameter issue:** `qDic` → `questionMap` (TypeScript convention)

**Impact:** Reduces code readability, harder to maintain

## Error Handling Analysis

### ❌ Critical Issues Found

#### Repeated Error Handling Pattern (DRY Violation)
**Severity:** High
**Occurrences:** 6 methods (lines 45, 67, 89, 112, 134, 156)

**Current Pattern:**
```typescript
catch (error: unknown) {
  this.store.logError(
    error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Failed to perform action.'
  );
}
```

**Issue:** Exact same error handling duplicated 6 times

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
// Create centralized helper
private handleError(error: unknown, defaultMessage: string): void {
  const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : defaultMessage;
  this.store.logError(errorMessage);
}

// Usage
catch (error: unknown) {
  this.handleError(error, 'Failed to perform action.');
}
```

**Impact:** Reduces duplication from 48 lines to 8 lines, improves maintainability

## Immutability Analysis

### ❌ Critical Violations Found

#### 1. Direct Object Mutation in `updateQuestion`
**Severity:** High
**Lines:** 78-79

**Current Code:**
```typescript
const question = this.store.entity();
question.title = newTitle; // ❌ Direct mutation!
question.category = newCategory; // ❌ Direct mutation!
this.store.setQuestion(question);
```

**Issue:** Mutates object directly, breaks Angular change detection with Signals

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
const question = this.store.entity();
const updatedQuestion = {
  ...question,
  title: newTitle,
  category: newCategory
}; // ✅ New immutable object
this.store.setQuestion(updatedQuestion);
```

**Impact:** Critical - ensures Angular change detection works correctly

#### 2. Array Mutation in `addItem`
**Severity:** High
**Line:** 92

**Current Code:**
```typescript
items.push(newItem); // ❌ Mutates array
```

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
items = [...items, newItem]; // ✅ New array reference
```

## Testability Assessment

### Current State
- **Test file exists:** ✅ Yes (`question-list.store.spec.ts`)
- **Coverage estimate:** ~70% (good but gaps remain)
- **Testability score:** 7/10

### Missing Test Coverage

#### 1. Error Path Testing
**Severity:** Medium
**Issue:** Only happy paths tested, error scenarios missing

**Missing tests:**
- Error handling when Firestore fails
- Behavior with invalid data
- Network timeout scenarios

#### 2. Edge Cases
**Severity:** Medium
**Missing scenarios:**
- Empty question list handling
- Concurrent updates
- Invalid IDs

**Recommendation:** Add 8-10 additional test cases for error paths and edge cases

### Testability Issues

#### Hard-coded Dependencies
**Line 34:** `private firestore = getFirestore()`
**Issue:** Hard to mock in tests
**Fix:** Inject via constructor/DI

## High Priority Issues

### 1. Function Complexity - `loadQuestions` method
**Lines:** 45-89
**Issue:** Method is 45 lines long with nested conditionals and multiple responsibilities

**Current Code:**
[code snippet]

**Recommendation:**
Split into smaller methods:
- `loadQuestions()` - orchestration
- `fetchQuestionsFromFirestore()` - data fetching
- `normalizeQuestionData()` - transformation
- `updateStoreWithQuestions()` - state updates

**Impact:** Improves testability, readability, and maintainability
